# db-version

A sample project meant to function as a git module for versioning micro-service psql databases.

# Dev Quickstart.

 * type `docker-compose up` to start a local postgres and admin web site.
 * go to http://localhost:8080 to pull up the admin web site.
    * host is "db"
    * db is version-test
    * Username and password are in the docker-compose.yml file

You now have a database and user with an empty DB to test running the provided samples or your
own scripts into.
